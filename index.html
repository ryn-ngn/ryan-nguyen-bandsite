                “We push each other to be the best. It’s not uncommon for one of us to say ‘this needs to be better,
                back to the drawing
                board’”

                    The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band consists of
                    lead vocalist Bryan
                    Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie
                    Fischer. The band
                    achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams.
                    Having worked with
                    other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident
                    the band could
                    succeed even further, pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the
                    Poster Charts. New
                    fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying their place
                    as one of the
                    hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as
                    “The Hive” and are
                    drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to touring in the future,
                    The Bees Knees are
                    currently recording their second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
